some text and explanation

/* maybe here we could have some periodic table plots / or transition metals only
e.g. how many plots per system (listed table) with solvents / conditions lists?!
Maybe periodic table in different colors, we need to adjust the periodic_table plot
function then individually, e.g. take 1 or two additional properties 
then we plot with color background and/or border color.

These plots can be updated automatically when the periodiuc table plot
takes e.g. as input some parameters that we can set in the header in the 
json path or the csv path. json and csv need to updated with a python 
script that is executed before calling mkdocs to render

Then periodic table overview to click to get to systems / elements

{{ periodic_table() }}
