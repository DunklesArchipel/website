# Systems

some text and explanation

/* maybe here we could have (listed table) and statistics on solvents / conditions lists?!
surfaces, .., this is not the periodic table where we have a lot of missing data
but only on the specific materials and surfaces that we have in the database

When clicking on one material/one surface we are forwarded to that specific 
material a surface.


We should have status pages of: each material (that is connected to periodic)
table. then we have on this page links to all surface pages for this material.
On all surfaces pages for this material we have then links to all individual system pages
where system is defined by substrate material, surface, electrolyte materials, electrolyte compositions, 
experiment, Temperature.

We should generate then on compile a database with all system
We can query this database then for generating all the pages
