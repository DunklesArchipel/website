# Standardized CV data

In general a CV is the measured current $j = -e \frac{ {\rm d} n_e}{ {\rm d} t}$ while cyclically scanning the potential $\Phi_E$. The current depends on the scan speed $v = \frac{ {\rm }d \Phi_E}{ {\rm d} t}$ as well as the active surface area (number of active surface sites). With 

In table we analyse different possible normalization schemes:



Different conventional normalizations are possible
