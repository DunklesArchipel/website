# echemdb - the community database for electrochemical data
echemdb is supposed to be a repository for high quality experimental and theoretical data on
single crystal electrochemical systems. In short, we collect data from the community and 
publications, trying to enable knowledge discovery by providing standardized and validated
data. For more information read [`About`](about.md) the project.


The navigation lists several experimental standard techniques, and results on selected 
elemental electrodes can be found in the respective lower hierarchies.

Our standardization methods as well the way this database / collection of data was 
obtained is explained in [`Standards`](cv/data__standardization.md)
