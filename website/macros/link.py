r"""
Implements a `link` macro that renders links to internal pages.

EXAMPLES:

When manually creating a link, say to `directory/file`, we need to take into
account from where this link is created to decide whether a URL can be written
as `../directory/file` or `../../directory/file` and so on.

While one could use absolute URLs, absolute URLs do not work when deploying to
a subdirectory which sometimes is what we are doing in GitHub deployments.
