# About the project

echemdb is a repository for high quality experimental and theoretical data on
single crystal electrochemical systems. 

While Electrochemistry has become a research field of increasing importance, high quality data is 
is very often only accessible for specific systems. 

Reliable and appropriately standardized data across different systems is still rare, especially
as small changes in the experiments can easily yield dramatic differences in the observations.
