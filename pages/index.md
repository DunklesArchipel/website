# echemdb - the community database for electrochemical data

## Philosophy
echemdb aims at standardizing electrochemical data according to the 
[FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), allowing 
for comparison between pubished data from the past with data acquired 
in the lab, and theoretical models.
The authors currently focus on cyclic voltammetry measurements 
on single crystal electrodes.

# Website content

The website shows the standardized and validated cyclic voltammograms
from the echemdb data repository, 
provided or carefully extracted from the literature
by the community.

::TODO: Iclude a figure of a CV (Pt111) and add a link to the respective entry.

# API

Add Link to a API and a code snippet as image

# Validation

Echemdb metadata schema

Add a figure of a json and yaml snipped

# digitization and preservation

SVGdigitizer

Add fancy figure showing raw and digitized data or something that we want to add on SVGdigitizer anyway.

<!-- 
The navigation lists several experimental standard techniques, and results on selected 
elemental electrodes can be found in the respective lower hierarchies.

Our standardization methods as well the way this database / collection of data was 
obtained is explained in [`Standards`](cv/data__standardization.md)
