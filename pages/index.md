## Philosophy

echemdb aims at standardizing electrochemical data according to the 
[FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), allowing 
comparison of published data with data acquired 
in the laboratory, and theoretical models.
The authors currently focus on cyclic voltammograms recorded 
on monometallic single crystal electrodes.

## Website content

The website shows cyclic voltammograms from the echemdb data repository,
which were standardized and validated from published works by the community.

!!! Note
    
    Include a figure of a CV of (Pt111) and add a link to the respective entry.
    Need to digitize an appropriate figure.

![API](https://dummyimage.com/800x600/)
<figcaption markdown>
## API

The entries in the database are accessible by the echemdb python module, 
which provides an interactive way to visualize, filter or evaluate the 
available data.

Get started with our interactive [example notbook](link to notebok),
or read more in our [documentation](https://echemdb.github.io/echemdb/).

!!! Note 

    Add link to demo notebook and a code snippet as image or gif.

![Validation](https://dummyimage.com/800x600/)
<figcaption markdown>
## Validation

To render all electrochemical data interoperable we designed 
a metadata schema for electrochemical measurements.

!!! Note

    Add a figure of a json and yaml snippet.

## digitization and preservation

!!! Note

    Add fancy figure showing raw and digitized data 
    (Maybe something that we want show on the website of SVGdigitizer)
