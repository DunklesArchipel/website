# Cyclic Voltammograms

The cyclic voltammograms (CVs[^1]) are categorized based on the type of system, 
i.e., aquoues or non-aqueous, as well as common descriptors (tags) used by the 
community to descibe an experiment. An entry can have several tags.

# Systems

* **Aqueous**: Aqueous systems use water as a solvent, which is mixed with ions from an acid, a base, a salt, or a combination of such chemicals.
Other chemicals or gases can be added.
* **Non aqueous systems**: Non aqueous systems refer to electrodes which are in contact with an ion conducting electrolyte.
The electrolyte can be a solid or a liquid. 
In the case of a liquid the solvent is either conducting by itself, such as for ionic liquids, 
or consits of a non-conducting solvent mixed with a salt.

# Tags

* **BCV**: We consider a base cyclic voltammogram as a CV that shows no electrocatalysis except possibly the decomposition of the electrolyte.
* **COOR**: CO Oxidation Reaction, usually studied in CO saturated electrolyte.
* **HER**: Hydrogen Evolution Reaction.

    used for the technique cyclic voltammetry.
