figure description:
  comment: Working solutions of the pH-series with values lower than 3 were prepared by using HClO4 and KClO4. For pH values ranging from 3 to 9, phosphate buffer solutions were employed (Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4). Alkaline solutions were prepared with NaOH and KClO4. The exact concentrations of these components are unkown.
