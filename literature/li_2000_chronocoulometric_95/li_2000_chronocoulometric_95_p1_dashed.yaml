electrochemical system:
  electrodes:
    configuration: 3
    counter electrode:
      material: Pt
      shape: coil
    reference electrode:
      type: SCE
    working electrode:
      crystallographic orientation: '111'
      material: Pt
      preparation procedure: A Pt single crystal bead was cut along the (111) orientation
        (geometric area of the (111) surface 0.043 cm2 ). The electrode was annealed
        in a hydrogen+air flame and then cooled down in a hydrogen atmosphere and
        later quenched with ultrapure water, before each experiment
