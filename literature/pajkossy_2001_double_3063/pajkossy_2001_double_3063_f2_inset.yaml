system:
  type: electrochemical
  electrodes:
    configuration: 3
    counter electrode:
      material: Pt
      shape: wire
    reference electrode:
      type: RHE
    working electrode:
      crystallographic orientation: '111'
      material: Pt
      preparation procedure: The electrode was annealed in a hydrogen or propane gas
        flame and, after cooling in nitrogen for about 1 min, it was immersed in water
        and thereafter transferred to the electrochemical cell with a protecting water
        droplet.
