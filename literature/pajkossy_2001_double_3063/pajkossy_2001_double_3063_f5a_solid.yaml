system:
  type: electrochemical
  electrodes:
    - name: CE
      function: counter electrode
      material: Pt
      shape: wire
    - name: REF
      function: reference electrode
      type: SCE
    - name: WE
      function: working electrode
      crystallographic orientation: '111'
      material: Pt
      preparation procedure: The electrode was annealed in a hydrogen or propane gas
        flame and, after cooling in nitrogen for about 1 min, it was immersed in water
        and thereafter transferred to the electrochemical cell with a protecting water
        droplet.
