electrochemical system:
  electrodes:
    configuration: 3
    counter electrode:
      material: Pt
      shape: wire
    reference electrode:
      type: RHE
    working electrode:
      crystallographic orientation: '111'
      material: Pt
      preparation procedure: Prior to each experiment the electrodes were flame annealed,
        cooled in a hydrogen/argon atmosphere and transferred to the cell protected
        by a drop of ultra-pure water saturated with these gases.
