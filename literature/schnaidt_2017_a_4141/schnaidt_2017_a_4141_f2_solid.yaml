  tags:
  - BCV
  instrumentation:
  - type: bipotentiostat
    model:  AFCBP-1
    manufacturer: Pine Instruments
    name: Pine bipotentiostat
system:
  type: electrochemical
  electrodes:
    configuration: three
    reference electrode:
      source:
        supplier: homemade
      type: RHE
    working electrode:
      crystallographic orientation: '111'
      material: Pt
      preparation procedure: The elctrode was prepared under UHV conditions by sputtering the electrode surface and subsequent controlled heating and cooling cycles, including oxygen adsorption during the cooling process. The final step only involved controlled heating and cooling.
