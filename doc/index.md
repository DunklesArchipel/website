Welcome to echemdb's documentation!
========================================

The echemdb module (i) provides direct access to the database and 
the entries presented on the [EchemDB Website](https://echemdb.github.io/website) 
and (ii) allows creating a database from local files which have 
the same file structure.

```{todo}
* What is echemdb and what is our aim.
* Refer to installation instructions, and all relevant sub-modules.
* Include information on meta data standards.
```
