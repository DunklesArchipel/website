jinja Templates
===============

Templates to render MarkDown with the [Jinja Templating
Engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/).

There are two kinds of templates. Those that render entire [pages/](pages/),
such as a template to render a page for an invididual CV, and those that render
shorter markdown snippets in [components/](components/).

Technically, these are almost identical. But only the former render a
frontmatter.
